# 🥐 Bakery Sales Prediction - Summer 2025

Forecasting sales for bakery products using machine learning and historical data  
📅 Dataset range: **July 1, 2013 – July 30, 2018**  
🎯 Focus: Predict sales trends for summer seasons, especially 2025

## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to forecast bakery product sales based on historical sales data from a local bakery branch. The dataset includes daily records for six key product categories:

- Bread  
- Rolls  
- Croissants  
- Confectionery  
- Cakes  
- Seasonal Bread  

Our goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a model that can predict daily sales for each category, with a focus on summer seasons. Starting from a baseline linear regression, we iteratively improve prediction accuracy using more advanced models.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Perform data preprocessing and visualization  
- Engineer useful time-based features (season, weekday, holiday, etc.)  
- Build regression models to forecast daily sales  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE and RMSE  
- Visualize real vs predicted sales for business insights
